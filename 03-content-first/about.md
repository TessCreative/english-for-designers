# My Story

Hi, I'm Tereza "Tess" Koudelková

**STORIES – CHARACTERS – GAMES**

> *"I am here to tell immersive stories about unique characters."*

It actually took me some time to realize this. I've always been a storyteller with enthusiasm for games. My vivid imagination and desire to show my stories in a visual form brought me to digital graphics. So, here I am, currently in the role of a student and a 3D generalist artist with aim to focus on storytelling and games.

I thought I've always knew what I wanted. It might have changed in time, but I always came back to stories.

I started as a book lover and an amateur writer. My passion for language took me to study literature on high school. Since the very first year, I wanted to get to a publishing house. Somewhen around the third year, I discovered 3D graphics, and it led me here. Soon, I decided that I'd like to focus on character creation. As my time at the university comes to its end, I realize, that I might want to take another step forward.

I came from a very different world of words to discover the world of digital graphics. My love for games aimes me that way, but I've never stopped telling stories.

# What Else Fills My Heart With Passion

When I'm trying not to drown in responsibilities, I'm probably:

- enjoying a good book (Fantasy or sci-fi? Bring it!),
- worldbuilding vast worlds and planning my own stories (writing, writing, writing),
- redesigning my blog for the thousand time (should probably do it again),
- trying to save my awesome players from themselves as a DM (Why? Just, why?),
- playing games (both board and video),

*Oh!* And you can always find me listening to music (I love Nightcore, just by the way!).
