## Presentation
Hi, I’m Tess.

I’d like to talk about a topic we creatives often find ourselves to struggle with – multiple passions.

But _why_ do we struggle with having more than just _the_ one interest (and they don’t all even have to be creative)?

We often hear things like: „You can’t do all that.“ / „You should focus on one thing and become good at it.“

And these we are told from an early age. Just think about, what is the first thing someone (most likely your family) asks you about your future? „What do you want to do when you grow up?“

Then, at school, we have to choose what field of studies we want to pursue. And again, we are forced to choose that one specific thing we most likely want to do for the rest of your life. But then we realise that we don’t. I changed the focus of my studies from literature to computer graphics. Seemingly two very different things without any connection. Yet, there is. They are both my interests.

Of course, not every area of interest is possible to study or do as a job. Still, it doesn’t mean we have to limit ourselves.

Having multiple hobbies isn’t a reason for diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder, yet it might lead to some kind of dissociation from one’s true personality. I often found myself in a situation:

- I want to do writing,

- I want to do graphics,

- I want to make games,

- I want to play games,

- I want to blog,

- I want to worldbuild,

- notetake,

- webdesign,

- …

I want to do _everything_!

I have this account with an artistic name under which I share my writing. | Later, I started to be interested in digital graphics, yet at that time, it didn’t feel much connected to my writing (even thou I planned to make my own book trailers or maybe even movies one day). But at that time, I just didn’t see the connection. So, I created another artistic account (and name) for purely my graphic work. | Then, at some point, I started to not just write my own original stories, but also fanfictions, and for some reason, I didn’t want to associate them with the rest of my writing (might be the language difference – I always write fanfictions in English while my original stories were in Czech –, or the unprofessionalism of writing, as I wanted to just write, getting lost in universes I love, without it having to be a perfect level of quality), so I created yet another account for only fanfictions. I also used to have one more artistic account for traditional drawing (which doesn’t exist anymore). | And each time I pursued a new interest, I created yet another alter-ego (call it artistic persona / nickname / or account) under which I shared it. Simply because I didn’t see a connection between them.

Often, I used to have this feeling of dissociation as I was slowly tearing apart my personality, shredding it into pieces.

I used to struggle with this for a very long time. Many artists feel the same.

Not so long ago, I asked myself the most important question: **Who am I?** And finally, it hit me. I am _all_ of these. I can’t choose just one. And so I found the connection. **Me**. All of these are my interests, my passions, all of these are _me_. And I want to do what I love.

Which brings me to another problematics someone might think about. Do you want to endear to everyone? No. I don’t do so many different things to attract as many people as possible. I do it because I want to do it, because I love it.

I don’t need thousands of followers or likes. If there is a few people who really care about what I care about, that’s enough. I am happy to make content for them. Because I know they care.

I’ll give you an example. Once, I shared one of my early stories on the internet. I didn’t think much about it back then. I just wanted to write something and get feedback. In the end, it became one of my bigger personal projects I still work on even after all those years. But then, only few people happened to acknowledged it. Majority of them were what I call „silent followers“. They go about without you even noticing (and that’s ok, I am a silent follower most of the time). But there was this one person who left me comments on each chapter, sharing their thoughts and feelings about the story. And that single person was what made me going. I was writing for them, because I felt that that person really cares. And that’s what I mean.

Of course, there’s always that risk of any fanbase. It doesn’t even have to be large, but the larger it gets, the bigger, dangerous and more possible the risk becomes. At first, people follow you because they like your work. Then, they get to know your work and you a bit more and start to demand specific things. At the end, they might make you to change your own way of doing things and you will start to shape your work to their liking, to please them, to not to loose them. Many artists have gotten trapped in that web (for example authors).

I know artists (hobbyists) – not personally, but I follow their work and see how it changes into what’s trendy now and followers expect them to do because everyone does it, right? And I find myself growing distant from what I used to like so much and what brought me to follow their journey at the very beginning. Probably because I am not that type of person who goes with the crowd. Yes, I am highly aware of how contra productive it might be, but I just do things my way. Maybe it means I am one of those trendsetters instead _:) (smile)_

**So, to sum it up:** _(One ring to rule them all – LOTR, Gandalf)_

- There’s absolutely no rule that you have to chose only one thing to focus on.
  
- There are many pieces of your personality, which together make the one true you.
  
- Don’t get trapped in that evil spider web.

It took me a while to accept myself as a multi-passionate person, but here I am, at the beginning of building my artistic brand. And if you guys want to stick near, **Tess Creative** will be happy to have you.

And remember, the next time you’ll find yourself facing a similar situation, stay true to yourself.
