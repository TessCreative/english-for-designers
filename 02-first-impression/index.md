STORIES – CHARACTERS – GAMES

I am here to tell immersive stories about unique characters in video games.

## Featured Projects

### Library
- A 3D interior of a library at night and day, quiet and peaceful, hiding many stories
- very first complex (and completed) environment made in Maya software
- school project for my 1st year finals
- day & night version



### Aki-Rain
- A 3D character sculpt based on the concept of the fursona by the artist of the same name
- school project
- challenge: working with two different concept arts and marging them together (differed in details)
- sculpting, texture (hand-painted), no retopology and rig (posing)

### Hidden World
- A short animation project on the theme of the “hidden world” – the inner world in which one gets lost when devoted to their passion (dancing)
- school project (2nd year finals)
- a collaboration with my brother (cameras, lighting, music) and one of my best friends (choreography)
- my very first complex animation
- funfact: Showing this project to some people from the animation work field brought a question if it's a mocap (hand-animated based on a reference from my friend)
