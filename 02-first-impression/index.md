# FIRST IMPRESSION

## About me
Tereza Koudelková

STORIES – CHARACTERS – GAMES

I am here to tell immersive stories about unique characters in video games.

## Projects
- Hidden World: A short animation project on the theme of the “hidden world” – the inner world in which one gets lost when devoted to their passion.
- Aki-Rain: A 3D character sculpt based on the concept of the fursona by the artist of the same name.
- The World of Iladen: A long-term in-developmen personal project. The world of Iladen is intended to be meant for narrative, cinematic, as well as for games and is designed as such.
