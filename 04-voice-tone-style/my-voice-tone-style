*Using emojis:* Through text, people can't see my body language, so I like to emphasise my tone of voice with emojis. With emojis, my messages doesn't sound so serious or dry. However, I use them only between friends, family and those I know on a friendly basis, not in a professional sphere. With those really close to me, we might even have an emoji set as a way for saying "Hi" or "Bye" ðŸ˜Š
