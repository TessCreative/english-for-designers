# My voice, tone, and style

## Voice
**Kind and Friendly:** Any time I communicate, I am kind and friendly. I respect others and hope they will do the same. Life taught me not to judge the book by its cover.

**Confident:** I know what I want and why, as well as what I do and why I do it. But that doesn't make me sarcastic, or smug. This confident voice is supposed not to put me above others as "someone better", it is supposed to show my competence and credibility in what I do.

**Caring:** I want the others to know that I care not just about what I do, but also about them. So, no matter who they are or from where they are, I care about everyone's opinion (even negative), comment, note, or question (_Remember. No question is stupid enough to be asked. Not even multiple times._). I keep in touch with those who reach out to me. Trolls? Haters? Scammers? Spammers? Let's go back to the first point and show them there are other ways to deal with people and get their attention.

## Tone
**Personal:** I care about what I do. And I want the others to see it. Using personal tone, I aim to get closer to others and make them feel welcomed. To show my love for what I care about and communicate on friendly bases to be more accessible. I show my interest, passion, enthusiasm,... but I will never exalt myself above others.

**Professional:** If the situation calls for it, I will use a professional tone to show I am serious about something, yet the voice won't change.

**Creative:** (_I do it my way_) I don't go with the crowd. Somethings popular and everyone is talking about it/is doing it? No, thank you. It might go against the mass rules, it might not attract so many people and bring me thousands of followers and likes. But it is how I want to do it. I don't want to deliver my content as everybody else to get lost among countless of similar ones. It might inspire me, but I won't copy it. Meaning, I try to make and deliver what I do as creatively interesting as possible, eve thou it might not be the current trend.

## Style
**Using emojis:** Through text, people can't see my body language, so I like to emphasise my tone of voice with emojis. With emojis, my messages doesn't sound so serious or dry. However, I do distinguish when and where to use them and when not. That's usually being between friends, family and those I know somehow closer (First, I need to get to know the person to say if it's alright for me to use emojis with them), not in a professional sphere (if not given otherwise). With those really close to me, we might even have an emoji set as a way for saying "Hi" or "Bye" ðŸ˜Š

**Don't use "ALL CAPS" UNLESS...:** Usually, I use other types of formatting such as **bold** or _italic_ to emphasis my thoughts, feelings or important words, HOWEVER; sometimes I do use all caps in personal notes to literally shout at myself for various reasons â€“ usually it's to not to forget or overlook something.

**Organised:** As an orginazed person, I need to have an order in everything I do, write, or present. So, if it's not among friends or family where I can get loose from these rules, my way of expression is neatly structures, whether it's an e-mail, presentation, article, video, or anything else. I structure the content do it goes through every important points of given topic, and explains all necessary details without causing confusion.
