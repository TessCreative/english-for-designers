Duolingo is a language learning app. The company's mission is to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available. Everyone can Duolingo.

## Voice
How their brand personality comes through in words. Four key qualities in both what they say and how they say it. Aim to build trust and familiarity. The tone will change based on the situation, but the voice is always uniquely Duolingo.

1. **Expressive**: Means biref, active voice, direct, exited, in your push notifications. Using simple words and phrases to convey big feelings. / Not long-winded, passive voice, uncelar, indifferent, in your face.
2. **Playful**: Means friendly, jolly, creative, clever in quick doses. Brings a burst of creative energy. / Not touchy-feely, sarcastic or smug, dry, intellectual. (Duo)
3. **Embracing**: Means supportive, gender-neutral (they, them), uses contractions, clear, well-meaning. Built on micro-successes. / Not aggressive, gendered (him, her, his), writing words out, comlicated, mean-spirited.
4. **Wordly**: Means interested, knowledgeable, universal, multilingual (but English first). Content that speaks to everyone and excludes no one. / Not smug, a know-it-all, slang or references not everyone knows, eglish only.

## Tone
Reading the room. Duolingo adapt the tone to the audience's state of mind (how the audience may be feeling) â€“ writing to that feeling with empathy.

1. **Clear**
2. **Human**
3. **Relaxed**

**Content**: What learning a language means for some people? Escaping lives they don't want. Telling stories, writing with respect, and treating the content not like content, but like someone's life. Sometimes they share funny pop-culture references, sometimes they share content that is much more serious.

**Context**: When learners succeed, they celebrate them. The Duolingo app is full of positive and negative moments. They watch their tone as learners navigate them.

## Style
Constructing their content to be clear and consistent. Mainly user-friendliness. Grammar and style rules based on usability.

1. **Numerals**: writing all numbers numerically X if a number starts a sentence, spelling it out
2. **Emoji**: (to one emoji) in push notifications, email subject lines, social media; in the title, in the body X not every notification needs an emoji (loosing impact)
3. **Puncuation**: (periods, dashes, colons, commas, ellipses, semicolons, apostrophes, quotes and quotation marks, ampersands) to help break information into readable chunks, and to dictate the tone of the content X not in headlines or subheads
4. **Formatting**: visual design for copy; not grammatical rules, just how they treat these at Duolingo (capitalization - minimal, lists, bold, italics, URLs and Email adresses)
5. **Parts of Speech**: their own rules for certain word types (not the nitty gritty of grammar) so the sentence reads naturally (contractions, conjunctions, prepositions)
