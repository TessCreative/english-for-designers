But. The two-sided blade word. Which one it’s going to be next time is all up to you.

We use but daily. Sometimes replacing it with a synonym to prevent its overuse. Based on the context, it can have either a positive or a negative meaning.

Like to hear someone saying „but“ if it indicated something good for you? Me too! It can change the whole meaning of the matter in that case.
	Imagine talking with someone about a test or a job interview you’ve just failed. And they say, „I know it was hard but hey, I know you’ve done all you could and am sure you’ll do better next time!“
	Or imagine planning a trip with your friends knowing your schedule is tight. There’s so much you need to do but you really want to go on that trip. So you say, „Hey, I have a lot of stuff going on right now, but I will either postpone it or finish it earlier, so I can join you guys!“
Using the positive but can have a positive impact on our lives and relationships. Ask yourself a question: Is it necessary? Do you really can’t think of anything to support the other? Do you really not have any time to change your schedule to make time for your friends? What is possibly going to have a better outcome? Saying, „Oh, sorry, I’d love to go, but I just have no time,“ or, „Well, I do have a lot of stuff going on this week but I can probably reorganise my schedule.“ So, is it truly necessary to do all those stuff at that time? Of course sometimes it is, but in those other cases, please, stop hiding behind the word but and rather get together your time management.

So, yeah, we like to hear the word but if it indicates something positive BUT we hate it if it means there’s a catch as it tells us that we probably won’t like what is about to follow.

The negative but can also have various forms. One of them might be using but as an attempt to make a situation we got ourselves into with our previous choice of words better. Usually a weak one. See this conversation for example: „I don’t like dogs.“, „I do have a dog.“, „Oh! I mean, I usually don’t like dogs, but your dog is super cool!“
Why is the negative but actually so dangerous? One doesn’t even have to say it out loud. Let’s call this unspoken but a „silent but“. Even if it isn’t said, we can still „hear“ it in the other’s speech. What gives this silent but away is the tone of the speaker’s voice. To recognise the tone of the other helps us to reveal their hidden intentions which they don’t say out loud, just as the word but.

If but doesn’t have just an informative meaning in the sentence – for example: „Everyone arrived at the meeting, but the manager wasn’t there.“ – one should be careful how they actually use it. That goes for all words, as words can hurt a lot if not used with discretion, even the common ones that we use every day.

So, remember, do use „but“ but carefully.
