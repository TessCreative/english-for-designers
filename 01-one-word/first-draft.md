But. A daily used word sometimes replaced with a synonym to prevent its overuse. 

Based on the context the word „but“ can have either a positive or a negative meaning. We like to hear someone saying „but“ if it indicates something good in the speech for us, BUT we hate it if it means there’s a catch, as it indicates that something we won’t like will follow.

The word „but“ – usually the negative one – can also be silent meaning one doesn’t even have to say it for us to hear it in their speech. What gives this „silent but“ away is the tone of the speaker. To recognise the tone of the speaker can help us to reveal their hidden intentions which they don’t say out loud, just as the word „but“.

„But“ can also be an attempt to make a situation we got ourselves into with our previous choice of words better. Usually a weak one. An example might be: „I don’t like dogs.“, „I do have a dog.“,  „Oh! You know, I don’t like dogs, but your dog is super cool!“ This example shows the attempt of the first speaker who doesn’t like dogs to reverse the embarrassing situation, although they don’t really mean it.

If the word „but“ doesn’t have just an informative meaning in the sentence – for example: „Everyone came, but the manager wasn’t there.“ – one should be careful how they use actually use it. That goes for all words, as words can hurt a lot if not used with discretion, even the common ones that we use every day.

So, remember, use „but“ but carefully.
